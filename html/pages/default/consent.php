            <p>After agreeing to the terms below, you will first follow a training session that will teach you how to read the data visualizations we will use during this study. This training ends with a comprehension check for which you will have two chances.
                Next, we will show you how to use the tools to make your final decision. Finally, you'll be asked to make one salary decision based on the visualization, and to explain this decision. The test ends with a questionnaire designed by social psychologists.
                This will require around twenty (20) minutes to complete.</p>
