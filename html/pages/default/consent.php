            <h4>IDENTIFICATION</h4>

            <p><strong>Project manager(s):</strong> <a href="http://petra.isenberg.cc/wiki/pmwiki.php" target="_blank">Petra Isenberg</a> (Senior Research Scientist, Aviz Team, Inria Saclay)</p><br />
                <strong>Other scientists involved: </strong>
<a href="https://florentcabric.com/" target="_blank">Florent Cabric</a> (Postdoctoral researcher, Aviz Team, Inria Saclay, Université Paris-Saclay)  </ul>

            <p><strong>Project team and Inria Research Centre:</strong> Aviz Team - Inria Saclay<br /><strong>Project name:</strong> Comparison of visualization-aided decision-making processes</p>

            <p>You are invited to take part in this project, whose the purpose is to understand how visualizations help people make decisions. The Aviz team conducts
                research in the field of visualization and the results of these experiments will help us to improve visualization design and research in this field more generally.</p>

            <p>This study will take place <strong>online</strong>. </p>

            <p style="color: darkred">The expected benefits of the project are the following:
                readability of a visualization has a considerable impact on a visualization’s use. Researchers investigating usability, effectiveness, and acceptability
                of visualizations can seek to evaluate participants’ perception of readability. To do so, they presently pick their own survey terms, for example “I am utterly confused”,
                “symbols were easy to read”, “I am confident in my answers”, “the visualization facilitates data understanding”, and so on. We currently lack a validated tool to evaluate the
                perceived readability of visual representations among study participants. The aim of this project is to build and validate a consistent scale to measure perceived readability.</p>

            <p>This project has received a favorable opinion from Inria's Operational Committee for the Assessment of legal and ethical risks. For more information: <br /><a href="https://www.inria.fr/en/operational-committee-assesment-legal-and-ethical-risks" target="_blank" title="OCELER">https://www.inria.fr/en/operational-committee-assesment-legal-and-ethical-risks</a></p>

            <p style="color: darkred"><strong>Procedure</strong><br />After clicking the experiment link, you will first answer this consent form.
               <!-- Then you will answer one question about you color vision, followed by thirty-nine (39) questions in total, about three (3) visual representations of data.
                This will require around sixteen (16) minutes to complete. -->

            <h4>PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION ACT</h4>

            <p>Inria is very attentive and vigilant regarding personal data protection (DCP) issues. It has also appointed a Data Protection Officer (DPO) for ensuring that Inria complies with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>

            <p style="color: darkred">These data are as follows: gender, age, education level, color vision deficiency, English fluency and prolific ID.</p>

            <p><strong>These data will be processed in the following manner:</strong>
                The study data will be logged in real time and will be stored on an encrypted server. Every day, the log files will be downloaded onto our Inria — thus, encrypted — computers.
                The dataset will automatically include Prolific identifiers for all participants.
                This identifier being the only feature making identification of persons possible, we will remove it from the dataset before analysis, effectively anonymizing the data.
