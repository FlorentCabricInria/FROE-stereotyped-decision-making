    <h1> Background Explanation</h1>
    <p><b>Imagine the following scenario</b></p>
    You are the person in charge of the company's annual salary review. The CEO give you 60 000 euros to increase the salary the employees -- your colleagues.
    The CEO told you to distribute the 60,000 as you want between two strategies:
    <ul>
        <li>
            reducing the gender pay gap (whether it's in favor of men or women)</li>
        <li>
            increasing people’s salaries based on their last year's performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Each colleague has been categorized into 3 grade groups*: 1, 2 and 3. The performance is represented in the chart by the
    _size of the dot _and the Y position corresponds to their salary. The performance metric is considered highly robust in your company. <br>

    Moving the sliders will update your employees' salary according to the strategy chosen. You can distribute the money as you wish between the two strategies
    (i.e., you can focus on just one), but all the money must be spent. <br>

    *grade groups= grouping job positions with similar skills, knowledge and experience and establishing job duties and levels of authority for that group

    <h1> Background Explanation</h1>
    To make your choice you will see a visual representation of your colleagues.
    In the following chart, each circle represents one of your colleague.
    The y-axis represents the salary of this colleague. In other words, the highest colleagues are in the chart, the more they are paid.

    <p>But to make a decision about salaries, you need more information about your colleagues than just their salaries. <br>
    In your company, employees are also categorized according to other attributes:
        <ul>
        <li> <b>Their last year's performance </b>: The high performers, medium performers and low performers</li>
        <li> <b>Their grade groups</b>: Grade group 3, Grade group 4 and Grade group 5 . "Grade groups" categorize employees with similar skills, knowledge and experience and establishing job duties and levels of authority for that group</li>

    <h1> Grade Groups:</h1>
    <p>In our visualization, grade groups are represented at different positions <br>
        Remember this chart and our two colleagues <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #0096c9;">Charlie</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #a8542b;"> Sam </span>:
    </p>
    <svg id="chartGradeGroups"> </svg> <br>
    The employees who belong to the same grade group will be grouped together. The grade group 3 will be on the left of the chart, the grade group 4 will be in the center and the grade group 5 will be on the right.

    As you can see <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #0096c9;">Charlie</span> belongs to <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #0096c9;">Grade Group 5</span> and  <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #a8542b;"> Sam </span>
    belongs to  <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #a8542b;"> Grade Group 4 </span>. <br>
    To be able to distinguish the employees — who are still your colleagues – we will add some "jitter". That means that the x-position of each dot will be moved slightly to the left or to the right.
