                    <p>Thank you for participating in our study! <b>Please read the following instructions carefully.</b></p>
                    <p>You will be shown 70 different images for <b>two seconds</b> each. Half of the images are <b>photos of surgical procedures</b>, while the other half are <b>neutral photos</b>. Some photos will be <b>filtered</b>, and some will be <b>unfiltered</b>.</p>
                    <p>For example, Image 1 below is an unfiltered photo. Image 2 is the same photo, but a filter has been applied.</p>
                    <div id="ExampleBlock">
                        <center>
                            <figure>
                                <img src ="html/img/filter_example/example.jpg" class="ImageExample"/>
                                <center><figcaption>Image 1 - Unfiltered photo</figcaption></center>
                            </figure>
                            <figure>
                                <img src ="html/img/filter_example/example-xdog_4.jpg" class="ImageExample"/>
                                <center><figcaption>Image 2 - Filtered photo</figcaption></center>
                            </figure>
                            <span class="clear"></span>
                        </center>
                    </div>
                    <p>You will see all 70 images in a random order, and you will be asked to rate each of them on two aspects:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>How difficult it was for you to look at this image?</b> If you did not find the image disturbing at all, then you should respond "easy". Conversely, if you found the image disturbing, then you should respond "difficult".</li>
                        <li><b>How difficult it was to recognize the image's content?</b> If you were able to easily recognize what the image was about, then you should respond "easy". Conversely, if it was difficult to see what the image was about, then you should respond "difficult".</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You will provide answers on a scale from "very easy" to "very difficult". For instance, you normally should not find Image 1 above disturbing, and it is easy to see what is depicted. So you could give, for example, the following reponses:</p>
                    <p><center><img src="html/img/filter_example/Screen1.png" id="scores1" class="ScoreImage"><br/></center></p>
                    <p>The filter used on Image 2 does not make the photo less or more disturbing, but it is less easy to see what it depicts. Therefore, you could give the following responses:</p>
                    <p><center><img src="html/img/filter_example/Screen2.png" id="scores2" class="ScoreImage"><br/></center></p>
                    <p>Alternatively, if Picture 1 was a photo of a particularly disturbing surgery procedure, then you could have responded this:</p>
                    <p><center><img src="html/img/filter_example/Screen3.png" id="scores3" class="ScoreImage"><br/></center></p>
                        
                    <p>Please note that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You will see each image for only two seconds, but you will have as much time as you want to answer the two questions. It is important that:
                            <ul>
                                <li>You pay attention to the image while it is displayed, i.e., right after you clicked the <i>"Next"</i> button.</li>
                                <li>You <b>do not accidentally invert</b> your responses (e.g., responding "very difficult" instead of "very easy"). Take your time to answer if needed.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>You will see each photo several times during the experiment, with different filters applied to them. You will notice these repetitions, but please try to respond to questions as if you were seeing each photo for the first time.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If anything is unclear or if you have any question, please ask the experimenter now.</p>
                    <p>Once you are ready to start the experiment, click the <i>"Next"</i> button below.</p>
