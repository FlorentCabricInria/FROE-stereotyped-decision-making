    <h2>A study on visual decision-making for salary adjustments in a company</h2>
    <p>You are invited to participate in our study called "<strong>A study on visual decision-making for salary adjustments in a company.</strong>"<br>The study will take around 20 minutes.</p>
    <p>Our goal is to understand how the use of interactive data visualization can impact the decisions in a context of salary adjustments. The results from this experiment will help inform the design
      of visualizations that are better suited to help decision-makers. </p>
    <p>Please respond to this survey only if you:</p>
    <ul>
